# House Prices Prediction

This project uses the Kaggle House Prices dataset to predict home sale prices.

## Steps
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Modeling (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation (RMSE, R²)
- Insights (feature importance)

## Results
- Random Forest performed best with RMSE ~ 25,000
- Key drivers of price: OverallQual, GrLivArea, GarageCars

## Why it matters
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with real-world messy data
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Communicate insights with visuals and storytelling
